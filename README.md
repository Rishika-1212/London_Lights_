POV: You’re 7 years old. It’s Christmas Eve in London. You are small, the car seat is big, and your only responsibility is staring out the window at the blurry lights. Adulting is paused.

London Lights is a cozy, aesthetic web experience designed to heal your inner child and cure your doomscrolling fatigue. It’s not about winning; it’s about that specific feeling of dissociation in the backseat of your parents' car while it rains. It’s giving main character energy.

Built with React and Tailwind CSS, because we like our nostalgia fast and our styles utility-first.

✨ Features (The Lore)

🚕 Infinite "Main Character" Drive: A never-ending journey through stylized London streets. The days switch to nights in real-time because we respect the laws of physics (mostly).

🌧️ Foggy Window 2.0: The glass fogs up. You can draw on it with your mouse. It’s like an iPad for people who remember life before the internet. Satisfying? Yes. Productive? Absolutely not.

💿 DJ Aux Cord (But Retro): A fully functional CD Player loaded with holiday bangers. None of that Spotify Wrapped; we’re manually skipping tracks like it's 1999.

🎁 The "Dad/Mom, Can We Stop?" Mechanic: Random halts where you collect virtual snacks (Hot Cocoa, Gingerbread) to fill the void in your soul.

Thank you Dad/Mom for the SURPRISE <3


🍅 Productive Rotting: Need to actually work? Hit "Sleep." The screen goes dark, the rain gets louder, and a Pomodoro timer starts. Nap for 25 minutes, then wake up and continue the journey.
